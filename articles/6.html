					Molly Reimer addresses Western Kane Dems on Crown TIF and Warehouses

					<strong>Sugar Grove, Illinois — </strong>
					Molly Reimer spoke to the
					<a href="https://www.facebook.com/WestKaneDems/"
						>Western Kane Democrats</a
					>
					on February 14th, sharing her perspective on the proposed Crown
					Community Development TIF and warehouses in Sugar Grove. Her full
					speech is included below.
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph"><strong>Speech</strong></p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					My name is Molly Reimer and I have lived in unincorporated Elburn
					since 2016 with my husband of 25 years and our three kids. I am so
					thankful to Heidi and the Western Kane Democrats for inviting me here
					tonight. I'm not a great public speaker but I'm going to do my best
					because this issue is so important to me. I will do my best to answer
					questions after I'm done speaking. Tonight, I'm going to be talking
					about TIFs. Specifically, the upcoming proposal of a TIF district or
					"Tax Increment Financing" district from Crown Community Development
					and Sugar Grove which will be located at I-88/R-47. On the south side?
					Residential and light commercial. On the north side? 3.5 million
					square feet of warehousing, data centers, and a truck stop. Roughly
					the size of four United Centers. Less than ¼ of a mile from hundreds
					of homes. Mine included. They're calling it "The Grove."
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					A year ago, I didn't even know what a TIF was or what it stood for. I
					think that's the case for most of us. Tax Increment Financing is a
					tool used to generate money to "improve" an undeveloped area. In a TIF
					district, the current property taxes are frozen for the duration of
					the project — most are 23 years, extendable up to 47 years. TIFs can
					and have done a lot of good for many communities that have fallen into
					hard times. They've been used successfully to breathe life back into
					broken communities and improve property values. Unfortunately, they're
					being abused all over the US by large corporations and developers.
					We're seeing it right here in Kane County.
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					Crown development (the 34th richest family in the US — worth almost
					$15 Billion) and the village of Sugar Grove (population 9,128) will be
					proposing that the 760 acres of prime farmland (actively being farmed
					by a local family) along Route 47 north and south of I-88 is eligible
					for a TIF by way of a small area of supposed "blight." You see, to
					qualify for a TIF, the developer must prove that the area they want to
					develop is blighted and no development would occur without it. The
					state's definition of blight is so vague it's almost impossible to
					challenge. For a minimum of 23 years the amount of revenue (EAV or
					Equalized Assessed Value) our schools, fire, police, libraries, and
					other taxing bodies currently receive will <strong>FREEZE</strong>.
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					All revenue resulting from any increases above this base value will go
					directly to the developer — Crown. Our schools <em>could</em> also
					receive a limited amount in "impact fees" but that is not for certain.
					Crown wants a 90/10 split plus management fees. They get 90 percent of
					all the revenue and Sugar Grove is left with 10 percent to divide
					among the 15 taxing bodies. For 23-47 years.
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					I will be 45 years old in May. That means possibly for my
					<strong>ENTIRE</strong> lifetime, our local taxing bodies would
					receive no increase in revenue. Despite a rising need for police &
					fire services, excess strain on schools, wear and tear on our roads.
					These services would all be stretched thinner than they currently are
					to enrich an already-wealthy developer.
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					TIFs and their proponents promise to spur development and revitalize
					depressed communities, but all too often they're used as political
					slush funds for private developers with comfortable political
					connections. Recent statements regarding a windfall of surplus funds
					from Sugar Grove's two current TIF districts are subject to the
					breakdowns of the taxing bodies' percentage shares. Only 4.66% of any of these
					released funds go to the Village of Sugar Grove. For example, of the
					recent $250,000 surplus, the Village received only about $11,650.
					Hardly enough to replace a small section of sidewalk.
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					We cannot afford to give handouts to wealthy developers at the expense
					of taxpayers. We are being told that this type of development is
					needed to "diversify" the tax base. How is this issue solved when the
					villages designate their prime business property to TIF districts? How
					is this type of growth possibly able to reduce or stabilize
					residential property taxes? It doesn't make sense. There must be a
					better way.
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					Administrations try to dismiss TIFs as "no cost to the taxpayers," but
					these millions of dollars will be repaid via a TIF Fund (aka property
					tax dollars diverted from our schools, libraries, parks, and other
					taxing bodies). Essentially these developers get to use property taxes
					that would normally go to these taxing bodies to subsidize their
					construction project. TIFs are complicated, but in short, they are
					massive tax giveaways to wealthy developers.
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					This is one of the reasons there is a growing wealth gap in the United
					States. It's not magic money. It must come from somewhere. The TIF ask
					for the Crown Development called "The Grove" is projected to be
					anywhere between $127-$350 million – one of the largest TIFs in
					Illinois outside of Chicago. One of 51 other TIF districts in Kane
					County alone. As more and more of these jumbo TIFs for billionaires
					are approved throughout Kane County, more homeowners will be forced to
					subsidize these tax drains. With states balancing budgets by slashing
					aid to school boards and other government bodies, local revenue
					matters more than ever. Costly long-term property tax abatements and
					TIFs granted to large companies in the name of economic development
					hurt our schools. They divert huge sums of property taxes for decades.
					Public schools are the lifeblood of our communities, and they are
					suffering.
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					I would also like to mention how TIFs can have a negative impact on
					health and safety. Chief Brendan Moran, of the Sugar Grove Fire
					Protection District, recently addressed his concerns at the Kaneland
					School Board meeting during public comment — explaining how existing
					TIFs have negatively affected his district. Many residents in the
					district have filed complaints citing poor response times to 911
					calls. He explained that adding another TIF in addition to the four
					they already have in his jurisdiction would be detrimental. One
					building in the TIF district only gives them about $80 a year in
					revenue. If it wasn't under a TIF, they'd be getting about $7,700 a
					year from that building. Another TIF would mean even more area/work to
					cover without the support of more revenue. Residents should know that
					if a fire protection district doesn't have finances they need, they
					don't have the manpower or full training for its station, other
					districts will be asked to cover calls for them or send mutual aid.
					When there are large accidents or fires, this is a given and is what
					should be expected especially with a development of this scale.
					However, when it becomes a manpower situation only, other departments
					can eventually deny their aid, as it puts unnecessary cost and strain
					on their own districts. This will negatively affect everything in that
					district, from effective emergency coverage to insurance rates to
					station morale. I should also note that in addition to this burden,
					the Sugar Grove and Elburn fire protection districts oversee all
					safety inspections for the 3.5 million square feet of warehouses at
					88/47.
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					As one of many residents on well and septic just north of the proposed
					development, it is extremely concerning that Sugar Grove has adopted
					permitted use zoning on all their business park zoning. Special use
					zoning would have given the village much tighter control over what
					types of hazardous materials could be stored on site and what types of
					businesses could be housed in the business parks. Most all other
					municipalities we contacted confirmed they apply special use zoning in
					their business parks/manufacturing. The aquifer that replenishes our
					wells is just ten feet below ground level in some places. We have site
					plans showing poor drainage and soil that is unfit to support the
					weight of these large buildings Crown is proposing and truck traffic.
					In order to develop the land, they will need to grade the hill some
					15-30 feet lower. Some area wells are less than fifty feet deep. We
					are all extremely concerned not only about what may end up in our
					water supply, but whether our wells will go dry. Both scenarios are a
					real possibility.
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					Keeping to the topic of health and safety, truck traffic is another
					huge concern. Since the construction of the interchange at 88/47 (for
					which Crown paid half of the costs), our area has seen an increase in
					serious traffic accidents. We have documents from IDOT stating there
					is no plan to widen or improve the area before 2029. If this warehouse
					plan is approved, Crown's traffic study estimates a minimum of 750
					additional daily truck trips in this area of Route 47. With new access
					roads to the business parks strewn in among roads to neighborhoods, I
					don't see how this isn't a recipe for disaster. Kaneland is a
					geographically large district with 9 towns busing students from
					Montgomery and Kaneville and Elburn to the middle school in Sugar
					Grove as well as the high school in Maple Park. Take Waubonsee College
					commuters into account as well. These buses, families and young
					student drivers will be trying to navigate these treacherous roads
					filled with semi traffic. I can't even begin to imagine it. With the
					TIF in place, there won't be extra funding to improve roads for a
					minimum of 23 years.
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					Currently there are 1,300 TIF districts scattered across our great
					state of Illinois. However, a number of taxing bodies have started to
					realize they are a scam, and some have even opted to sue municipal
					governments for implementing them. TIF reform has earned bipartisan
					support in Springfield with two bills currently in the General
					Assembly that would amend the state's loose definition of "blighted
					area." Lawmakers would be wise to take this common sense step toward
					reducing the role of TIFs in local government.
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					Somehow, someway, we collectively must stop this madness and stand
					against politicians being used as pawns to the sophisticated marketing
					scams of these billionaires. It's time to wake up and shake up this
					broken system. I support TIF reform in Illinois and especially here in
					Kane County. I hope you will join me. Thank you.
