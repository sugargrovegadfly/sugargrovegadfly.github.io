					<strong>Sugar Grove, Illinois â€” </strong>If you're in the mood for a
					culinary experience offering a modern take on All-American fare, look
					no further than
					<a href="https://thefiresidegrillesugargrove.com/">Fireside Grille</a
					>. Since its opening in 2005, this establishment has carried on the
					legacy of House of Plenty Smorgasbord, serving up comfort food with a
					contemporary twist. The ambiance is a unique blend of rustic charm and
					modern elegance, highlighted by its vaulted wood ceilings,
					midcentury-modern lighting, and extensive stonework in the bar and
					throughout the establishment, including the cozy fireplace that gives
					Fireside its name.

					Their in-house smoked ribs are a must-try for BBQ aficionados.
					Expertly dry-rubbed and slowly roasted, these ribs are lovingly basted
					in a homemade BBQ sauce. The result is a tender symphony of flavors,
					offering a perfect blend of smoky depth and a sweet, tangy finish. For
					those with a penchant for greens, the roasted brussels sprouts are a
					revelation. Topped with a luscious balsamic glaze, chimichurri aioli,
					and a sprinkle of Parmesan, these sprouts transform a classic side
					dish into an epicurean adventure. If you're looking to take the
					"fireside" more literally, try the saganaki, a careful nod to
					international flavors. Featuring Kasseri cheese from Greece flambeed
					in brandy and finished with lemon, this dish brings a creamy and
					bright element to the table, offering a nice contrast to the
					predominantly New-American menu.

					Fireside boasts a history as rich and intricate as its diverse
					culinary offerings. Situated next to the site of the former Illini
					Motel, its location is deeply rooted in Sugar Grove's lore, a story
					that unfolds with the pioneering endeavors of Ed and Marian Saloga. Ed
					and Marian met in Aurora in the 1930s, where they loved to play tennis
					at Phillips Park. Ed began building homes in 1948, which eventually
					led to the Salogas building the motel in 1953 and 1954. On a chilly
					December day in 1953, the Salogas found their new home in Sugar Grove,
					then a close-knit community of 175 residents. Despite the frosty
					weather, their hearts were quickly warmed by the community's embrace.
					Reverend Mercer of the Methodist Church, located just down Main
					Street, extended a heartfelt welcome. This warmth was further kindled
					at the school's Christmas program, where the genuine
					friendliness of the townspeople enveloped the Salogas, making them
					feel deeply connected to this charming village from the very start.
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					In May 1954, the Salogas' motel unexpectedly opened its doors ahead of
					schedule, prompted by the arrival of five guests in need of rooms.
					With the interiors tidy but the drapes unfinished, the Salogas
					embraced a can-do spirit, swiftly setting up bedding and temporary
					curtains, thereby marking the motel's inaugural day. The following
					years witnessed growth; 1957 brought the addition of three units and
					an extra storeroom. A notable highlight was 1959's installation of an
					Esther Williams swimming pool, becoming a neighborhood favorite for
					their children and local youth. However, the pool's presence was
					short-lived; in 1960, the state bought a portion of the motel's
					frontage to build the cloverleaf, necessitating the removal of the
					pool. Though they lost two direct accesses, they gained the frontage
					road, which remains to this day.
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					In 1961, the Salogas expanded their entrepreneurial ventures by
					constructing House of Plenty adjacent to the motel, the very site
					where Fireside now resides. For a decade, the establishment was leased
					to Mr. and Mrs. Ray Weltch, along with their daughter and son-in-law,
					Eva and Chester Leland. Following this period, in 1971, George and
					Georgia Ratos took over the reins, initially renting and later
					acquiring the restaurant. Leadership eventually passed to their son
					Jim and grandson Jimmy, who continued the legacy of House of Plenty.
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Salogas further developed
					the property, adding apartments behind the motel. Their contributions
					to Sugar Grove's landscape extended beyond the motel, as they also
					constructed numerous homes in the area, including their personal
					residence in Dugan Woods. After the apartment expansion, they sold the
					motel to Dolly and Ed Kunsh. A transformative moment came in 1982 when
					the Ratoses purchased the motel, converting it entirely into
					apartments, shaping the form it retains today.
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					Fireside's journey from House of Plenty to present reflects the
					enduring legacy of Sugar Grove. Whether you're savoring their
					delectable dishes or immersing yourself in the surrounding history, a
					trip to Fireside ensures a memorable experience.
