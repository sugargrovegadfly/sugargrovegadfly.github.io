					Sustainable Visions: A Q&A with Melinda Bossenga and Jera Piper,
					Candidates for the Kane-DuPage Soil & Water Conservation District
				</h2>
				<h4 class="date">Monday, February 5, 2024</h4>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					<strong>Sugar Grove, Illinois — </strong>
					On February 8th, from 7:00am-5:30pm, the
					<a href="https://kanedupageswcd.org/kd/"
						>Kane-DuPage Soil & Water Conservation District</a
					>
					(KDSWCD) will be holding an election at their office located at
					<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/FGTULn5Z7hsHccvo7">
						2315 Dean St, Suite 100 in St. Charles</a
					>. We reached out to two of the challengers, Melinda Bossenga and Jera
					Piper, to learn about what they hope to accomplish, if elected.
					Biographies for all six candidates can be found
					<a href="https://lp.constantcontactpages.com/cu/5PTp4IS">here</a>.
					Absentee voting is available through February 6th, from 8:00am-4:30pm,
					at the same location. Absentee voters must certify the nature of their
					inability to vote on the election day. All owners or occupiers of land
					in Kane or DuPage county of legal voting age are eligible to vote in
					the election.

				<p class="article-paragraph">
					Soil & Water Conservation Districts are local units of government that
					provide technical information to individuals and groups on methods of
					soil and water conservation. One of the most important outputs of
					these districts are
					<a href="https://kanedupageswcd.org/kd/natural-resource-inventory"
						>Natural Resource Inventories</a
					>, which are detailed reports based on standardized data and onsite
					investigations that provide insight into land use change decisions and
					that ensure development properly protects the districts' natural
					resource base.
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph"><strong>Q&A</strong></p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					<strong
						>Can you discuss your stance on major land development projects? How
						do you think we should balance economic growth with environmental
						conservation?</strong
					>
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					<strong>Melinda Bossenga:</strong> I know that as the population
					increases, land development is likely inevitable. My stance is that it
					needs to be sustainable, and helpful or advantageous to the overall
					community and ecology. Without a healthy environment, all life
					suffers. We live in a web and when one species is impacted, all
					species are impacted. The environmental impacts of a development
					should be minimal. If a major development only has economic benefit
					for a select few, then it should not be considered. Citizens and the
					environment should not be paying the price for wealthy corporations to
					become wealthier.
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					<strong>Jera Piper:</strong> My stance is major land developments
					should only be considered where the land is considered a brownfield
					development or infill development, which prioritizes the reuse of
					existing developed land before expanding into undeveloped or
					greenfield areas. My balanced approach of economic growth with
					environmental conservation is a growing concept of Green Growth
					alongside Sustainable development, which seeks to meet present needs
					without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their
					own needs. Sustainable development encourages implementing policies
					and practices that prioritize environmental protection and social
					equity alongside economic growth. Sustainable development aims to
					ensure that economic prosperity is achieved within the boundaries of
					ecological sustainability, thereby mitigating negative environmental
					consequences.

				<p class="article-paragraph">
					<strong
						>How do you plan to address concerns regarding the proposed 3.5m
						sqft of logistic warehousing by Crown Community Development and
						Sugar Grove?</strong
					>
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					<strong>Melinda Bossenga:</strong> The wave of warehouses is waning.
					The Covid craze of buying things online is slowly dissipating. We will
					always have online shopping and therefore fulfillment centers, but
					people are buying from brick-and-mortar shops again. Drive around and
					you will likely see empty warehouses seeking tenants. It’s a dying
					trend and we should be smart and be ahead of the trend. I plan to
					continue to fight against developments that don’t truly consider the
					deleterious impacts their methods have on the land, especially as they
					are requiring multi-million-dollar TIFs that do not truly benefit the
					community or the environment. I will always ask if there are
					alternatives to building new warehouses. Can warehouse needs be met in
					already existing warehouses? We need to ask those questions and get
					creative. Is there something else viable that could go in the space
					allotted for the warehouses? We cannot keep building on open space as
					we are and expect people to want to live in our communities. I will
					continue to attend board meetings, share my concerns with others and
					help spread the information of what is happening.
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					<strong>Jera Piper:</strong> I would continuously monitor that the
					Crown project complies with all local, state, and federal
					environmental regulations. Work to minimize the environmental impact
					by implementing green building practices, sustainable transportation
					solutions, and stormwater management plans.
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					<strong
						>What is your vision for future development in Kane and Dupage
						counties? How do you plan to incorporate sustainability and
						environmental protection into these plans?</strong
					>
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					<strong>Melinda Bossenga:</strong> I think there is a growing trend
					for folks to be connected to the land through farms, wetlands,
					wildlife and such. My vision is to help that grow. Preserving these
					gems will keep people wanting to live in these counties. There are so
					many hobby farmers now, where, when I was a kid, I maybe knew one.
					People love farmers markets and being more connected to where food
					comes from.
					<a href="https://rusticroadfarm.com/">Rustic Road Farm</a> in Elburn
					is one that comes to mind. They were just selected by The Conservation
					Fund’s
					<a href="https://www.conservationfund.org/our-work/working-farms-fund"
						>Working Farms Fund</a
					>
					to lease a 30-acre property in Elburn and the property will go into a
					conservation easement. Rustic Road Farm is a very successful farm that
					provides jobs and supports a healthy environment with their farming
					practices while providing nourishing food for communities, all while
					reducing environmental impacts by diminishing shipping emissions and
					conventional farming chemicals. To quote
					<a href="https://www.aldoleopold.org/about/aldo-leopold"
						>Aldo Leopold</a
					>, “A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity,
					stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it
					tends otherwise.” I’d encourage a synergistic relationship between a
					strong land ethic and economic development.
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					<strong>Jera Piper:</strong> My vision for Kane and DuPage counties is
					to promote biodiversity and ecosystem protections by educating the
					people of the counties about habitat protections and building green
					infrastructures. This can be achieved through the integration of green
					spaces, conservation of water bodies, and preservation of natural
					landscapes within and around development projects. Lastly, utilizing
					green infrastructure such as parks, green belts, and urban forests to
					support biodiversity, improve air quality, and provide recreational
					spaces for communities.
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					<strong
						>How do you plan to engage with different stakeholders, such as
						residents, environmental groups, and businesses in your
						decision-making processes?</strong
					>
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					<strong>Melinda Bossenga:</strong> I feel that transparency is
					crucial. I have never been on a board such as this, so I’d have a
					learning curve. I’d encourage engagement by holding informational
					meetings, however, I know that sometimes those are not well-attended.
					We are a busy culture. Perhaps webinars or virtual meetings. I want to
					hear people’s concerns and wants.
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					<strong>Jera Piper:</strong> My plan of engagement is an
					implementation of community engagement activities, such as public
					consultations, workshops, surveys, questionnaires and focus groups. I
					also strongly believe in transparency and information sharing. Regular
					open access to information and continuous updates informing all
					parties involved.
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					<strong
						>With increasing focus on environmental issues and policies at both
						state and national levels, how do you plan to adapt or align the
						board's strategies to these evolving standards?</strong
					>
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					<strong>Melinda Bossenga:</strong> I would be doing a lot of research
					to make sure that state and federal regulations are being implemented
					as they evolve. I think as standards change, my goal remains the same:
					to protect our land, water, communities, health, and overall ecology.
					We are coming upon a threshold where our land and water can only take
					so much more. I would be diligent in doing my homework, as it were, to
					make sure policies are being followed, based on the organization’s
					standards.
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					<strong>Jera Piper:</strong> Aligning with evolving environmental
					standards and policies requires staying informed, engaging
					stakeholders, investing in sustainability, and integrating
					environmental considerations into strategic planning and operations.
					This will maintain KDSWCD's status as an organization and ensure
					compliance to position us as a leader in environmental stewardship.
