				<h2>From Quivers to Quorums: Jaden Chada</h2>
				<h4 class="date">Sunday, December 3, 2023</h4>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					<strong>Sugar Grove, Illinois â€” </strong>A young figure, carrying the
					gravitas of a seasoned leader and shining brightly as a beacon of
					local activism, has surfaced in the close-knit community of Sugar
					Grove. Jaden Chada, barely 19, stands as a paragon of commitment and
					determination, relentlessly advocating for the welfare of his
					neighbors.
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					Born into a family that's been around these parts longer than most can
					remember, with ties running back three generations, Jaden's lineage is
					as local as the
					<a href="https://sugargrovecornboil.org/">Sugar Grove Corn Boil</a>,
					of which he's the recently-elected vice president for the 2024 event.
					Though he technically hangs his hat a stone's throw away in
					unincorporated Blackberry township, his spirit, his fire, and his
					endeavors are deeply rooted in the heart of Sugar Grove. Here, he
					attends
					<a href="https://villagebible.church/sugar-grove/"
						>Village Bible Church</a
					>; it's also where his kinsfolk reside and operate small businesses.
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					When Jaden speaks, it's not with the brashness of youth we've come to
					expect, but with a wisdom that belies his years, a wisdom forged in
					the crucible of meticulous research and deep dives into the
					labyrinthine world of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and
					gritty meetings with the who's who of community stakeholders. His
					words aren't just words; they're carefully fletched arrows of truth,
					notched with the insight and understanding of someone who's seen the
					world through lenses most his age haven't even found yet.
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					His education, as one might expect, is also homegrown: he's a product
					of <a href="https://kss.kaneland.org/">John Shields Elementary</a> and
					<a href="https://www.aurorachristian.org/">Aurora Christian</a> for
					middle and high school. He graduated high school with a 3.995 GPA (a
					4.0 with a rounding error, if you ask us) and a
					<a href="https://www.acsi.org/DCHSS"
						>Distinguished Christian High School Student Award</a
					>
					for outstanding achievement in academics. Jaden's athletic success
					parallels his academic success. An accomplished competitive archer, Jaden
					has a quiver full of state titles and even a national championship, a
					source of pride for his grandfather, Jeffrey, who accompanied him to
					tournaments. The bond between Jaden and his grandparents is the stuff
					of heartwarming tales. Raised under the same roof as them, he soaked
					up more than just family values. He inherited a love for Montana, a
					vast land of open skies and untamed wilderness. Inspired by this,
					Jaden took to the skies, quite literally, starting lessons at
					<a href="https://www.aurora-il.org/768/Airport-Information"
						>Aurora Municipal Airport</a
					>. His eyes were set on
					<a href="https://www.montana.edu/about/">Montana State University</a>,
					dreaming of a future in aviation, soaring above the clouds, free as a
					bird. But as life often does, it threw a curveball, reshaping his path
					in ways he never expected.
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					This January hit with the weight of a sledgehammer: Jeffrey was
					diagnosed with cancer. Jaden made the tough decision to stay put,
					enrolling at
					<a href="https://aurora.edu/index.html">Aurora University</a> and
					commuting so he could be there to assist in his grandfather's care.
					After a short-yet-valiant battle, Jeffrey passed away in late May,
					aged just 58. Faced with this immeasurable void, Jaden chose to stay
					home to support his now-widowed grandmother and to explore his
					newfound calling, nursing, inspired by a deep desire to help care for
					others.
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					This same burning passion fuels Jaden's local activism, too. Late
					April saw Jaden begin volunteering with
					<a href="https://www.facebook.com/i88corridordevelopmentsugargrove/"
						>Thoughtful Progress</a
					>, a group comprised of Blackberry Township and Sugar Grove residents,
					opposed to a colossal proposed
					<a href="https://thegroveillinois.com/">development</a> at the
					intersection of Interstate 88 and Route 47.
					<a href="https://crowncommunities.com/">Crown Community Development</a
					>, the developer, wants to annex approximately 800 acres of farmland
					into Sugar Grove to build 3.5 million square feet of logistics
					warehousing, adjacent to residential neighborhoods in Blackberry
					Township. Despite their proximity, as unincorporated residents, they
					have no vote in the matter. Jaden, ever the outspoken advocate, has
					become a regular fixture at village board meetings, a voice for the
					health and safety of his community. Indeed, health and safety has
					become Jaden's rallying cry. In September, he addressed the board in
					favor of proposed intersection improvements at Park Avenue and Route
					47. The need for improvements there literally struck close to home: in
					February 2019, his grandfather was t-boned in that intersection.
					Traffic accidents, Jaden argues, are not going to diminish with
					hundreds of additional trucks on the roads.
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					Next, when Jaden heard that the Corn Boil might be cancelled due to a
					volunteer shortage, it was a no-brainer for him to step up and to help
					bring fresh ideas to the table. At Aurora Christian, he helped prepare
					for school events and functions and volunteered on the annual weeklong
					mission trip. He also has previously staffed security for events such
					as the <a href="https://www.kanecountyfair.com/">Kane County Fair</a>,
					the
					<a
						href="https://mortonarb.org/explore/activities/exhibitions/illumination/"
					>
						Morton Arboretum Lights Show</a
					>, and events at the
					<a href="https://dupagecountyfair.org/">DuPage County fairgrounds</a>.
					He hopes to bring lessons learned through these experiences to his
					Corn Boil leadership.
				</p>
				<p class="article-paragraph">
					The clear potential <em>The Sugar Grove Gadfly</em> sees in Jaden
					isn't so obvious to others: he's been subject to a surprising amount
					of unwarranted criticism concerning his advocacy and his age,
					criticism that we intend to investigate further in future articles.
					Several incidents stick out. A drainage district commissioner
					purportedly referred to Jaden as a "hoodlum," a phrase one typically
					reserves for violent criminals. Deeply ironic is the fact that between
					the two men, Jaden is the only one without a rap sheet. Jaden
					hilariously reclaimed the mean-spirited comment and purchased a hoodie
					emblazoned with the words "five star hoodlum," which he can often be
					seen wearing at rallies outside village board meetings, with his "no
					warehouses" sign in hand. Another noteworthy incident involves a
					village trustee, out of the blue, sending a message to one of Jaden's
					family members inquiring about how Jaden's parents died and if that's
					the reason why he is so "bitter." Jaden's got his doubts about these
					trustees and their Sherlock-Holmes-level investigative skills, given
					that Jaden's parents are very much alive. Even the village president
					hopped on the mudslinging bandwagon, unfoundedly accusing Jaden of
					calling the police on her. Allegedly, she directed a drone operator to
					record a promotional video for the village on private property without
					permission from the property owner. But guess what? The
					<a href="/images/2b.jpg">dispatch report</a>, obtained by a FOIA
					request to the Kane County Sheriff's department, clearly shows that
					Jaden was not the caller.

					Jaden Chada is not just a young figure in Sugar Grove; he is a
					dedicated leader, an advocate for his community's well-being, and a
					symbol of resilience in the face of adversity. His journey is a
					testament to the power of youth and an unwavering commitment to
					making a positive impact on the world. As he continues to shape the
					future of Sugar Grove, we believe Jaden's story is one that will be
					remembered and celebrated for years to come.
